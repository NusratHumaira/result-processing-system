## Result Processing System

This web project was built using Laravel Framework. Using the Result Processing System, we will be able to manage the result and organize the results for the students to view online. Both students and teachers need to register at the beginning of the course. The teacher will be able to read, write and edit the results as an admin. Students will only be able to view his/her own results and download them in pdf format. Exam committee members will have privileges to see the complete result of any course.
